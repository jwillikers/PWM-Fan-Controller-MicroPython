== Hardware

All the hardware components in my particular build are enumerated here.

.Fan Controller Components
* {Raspberry-Pi-Pico}
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/64[Half-size breadboard]
* {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan}
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/1787[74AHCT125 - Quad Level-Shifter]
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/759[Premium Male/Male Jumper Wires - 40 x 3" (75mm)]
* micro USB Power Supply for the microcontroller

Programming will require a micro USB cable and a computer.

== How it Works

This is a dead-simple PWM fan controller that simply lowers the speed of the {Noctua-NF-P12-redux-1700-PWM-Fan} to a quiet 40%.
The microcontroller simply sets the fan speed and then does nothing.
The fan setup might evolve in the future to take into account temperature sensing and dynamic speed adjustment.

The 3.3V microcontrollers used here require a logic-level shifter to boost the PWM signal up to 5V for the fan.
I use the 74AHCT125 to perform the logic-level conversion, using pin #40, `VBUS`, to provide the 5V reference voltage.

The Raspberry Pi Pico draws a steady 20.78 mA of power.
If you're concerned about power usage or type safety, then you might be interested in my Rust-based implementation, https://github.com/jwillikers/PWM-Fan-Controller[PWM Fan Controller].
The Rust-based version sips a bit less power on the Pico, 2.07 mA.
This is probably mostly due to the fact that the Rust-based version runs entirely off the low-power Ring Oscillator clock instead of the Crystal Oscillator.
If you know any ways to improve the energy usage, feel free to get in touch or contribute!

== Shortcomings

. MicroPython does not yet support deep sleep for the RP2040 board.
Deep sleep after setting the PWM would conserve energy.

== Getting Started

The instructions here setup the software for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
It is assumed that you are on and familiar with Linux and using MicroPython on microcontrollers.
{Fedora-Silverblue} 37 is used as the reference operating system and the shell used is {fish}.

[TIP]
====
To access the serial connection to the Raspberry Pi Pico without requiring superuser privileges, add your user to the `dialout` group.

[source,sh]
----
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
----

Now restart for the change to take effect.
====

. Hold down the button marked _BOOTSEL_ on the board while plugging it in to your computer with a micro USB cable.
The RP2040 should automatically be mounted as a disk on your computer.
In my case, it has been mounted at `/run/media/jordan/RPI-RP2`.
The lsblk command can be used to find where it has been mounted
+
[source,sh]
----
lsblk
----

. Download and install MicroPython using the latest stable version of MicroPython, version 1.19.1 at the time of writing.
The MicroPython firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico is available on the https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/[Raspberry Pi Pico MicroPython Download page].
+
[source,sh]
----
wget -qLP /run/media/$USER/RPI-RP2 https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/rp2-pico-20220618-v1.19.1.uf2
----

. Wait for the file to finish copying.
When it is done, a serial console will become available which provides access to the board.
This serial port can be found with the `dmesg` command as follows.
+
--
[source,sh]
----
dmesg | tail

----

`ttyACM0` in the preceding output indicates the device node.
This device resides under `/dev` on the filesystem.
Note the name of the device shown in your output, since it will be used to copy the source code to the microcontroller's on-board filesystem.

. Clone this project's repository.
+
[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/PWM-Fan-Controller-MicroPython.git
----

. Change into the project directory.
+
[source,sh]
----
cd PWM-Fan-Controller-MicroPython
----

. Create a virtual environment for the project.
+
[source,sh]
----
python -m venv .env
----

. Activate the virtual environment.
+
[source,sh]
----
source .env/bin/activate.fish
----

. Install the development dependencies.
+
[source,sh]
----
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
----

. Download the MicroPython `pyboard.py` script for accessing the microcontroller.
+
[source,sh]
----
wget -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micropython/micropython/master/tools/pyboard.py
----

. Copy the `main.py` source code file to the microcontroller.
+
[source,sh]
----
python pyboard.py --device /dev/ttyACM0 -f cp main.py :
----

. Once the previous command finishes, you may unplug the board.

== Development

It's recommended to create a virtual environment for the project and to use the provided {pre-commit} checks when developing.

. Install the Git hooks for pre-commit.
.
+
[source,sh]
----
pre-commit install
----

. The pinned development packages in the `requirements-dev.txt` file can be upgraded with the `pip-compile` command from the {pip-tools} package.
+
[,sh]
----
pip-compile \
  --allow-unsafe \
  --generate-hashes \
  --reuse-hashes \
  --upgrade \
  requirements-dev.in
